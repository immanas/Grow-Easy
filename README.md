# 🛍️ GrowEasy: AI‑Driven Retail Optimization for Shopify Stores
🌟 GrowEasy – AI‑Powered Inventory &amp; Pricing Optimization for Shopify  Unlock smart retail management with real-time demand forecasting, automated insights, and a full serverless architecture—built entirely on AWS with SageMaker, Lambda, DynamoDB, and React.


## 🛍️ What is Shopify?


[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) is a popular **e-commerce platform** that allows anyone to easily create and manage an online store.  shopify dashbord.png.png
It helps businesses sell products, track orders, manage inventory, and handle payments — all in one place.
Think of it like a **digital shopping mall** that gives store owners everything they need to run a business online, without writing code.

## 🚀 Full System Architecture 
GrowEasy transforms raw Shopify store data into **actionable insights** using a fully serverless, AI-driven AWS pipeline.
🧠 Built entirely using modern AI & cloud-native AWS technologies:

### 🔄 Pre-AWS Steps in GrowEasy Integration

| 🔢 Step | 📝 Description | 🔍 Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1️⃣ Create App using Shopify Partner Dashboard** | You create the GrowEasy app inside the Shopify Partner portal. This gives you app credentials (API Key/Secret), scopes, and the ability to install it on a store. | Required to define permissions like `read_products`, and to enable installation into merchant stores. |
| **2️⃣ Install the App in a Merchant’s Store** | The merchant (store owner) installs the GrowEasy app via a secure install link (OAuth or manual). | App is now authorized to access that specific store’s product and inventory data. |
| **3️⃣ Register Webhooks using Shopify Admin API** | After install, your app calls the Admin API to register webhook topics like `products/create` and `products/update`. | These webhooks let Shopify notify your app automatically when product data changes. |
| **4️⃣ Receive Webhook POST Requests (JSON Payload)** | Shopify sends a POST request (with product data) to your specified API endpoint whenever a registered event occurs. | Real-time product events (title, inventory, price, SKU, tags) are pushed out as JSON. |


### 🔄 1. Webhook Data Collection

## 🔄 Data & AI Workflow

**Shopify → Lambda → S3 (raw data)**  
Whenever a product is created, updated, or deleted in Shopify, the platform automatically sends a **webhook event** in JSON format.  
- These webhook events are received by an **AWS API Gateway endpoint**, which forwards them to a **Lambda function**.  
- The Lambda function stores each raw JSON payload exactly as it arrives into the S3 bucket **`groweasy-webhook-logs`**.  
- This bucket acts as the **system of record**, keeping a full history of product changes, price updates, and inventory modifications for downstream analytics.  

---

**Hourly Analytics Lambda → S3 (aggregated data)**  
A second Lambda function, triggered **every hour** by **Amazon EventBridge**, processes the raw data into structured summaries.  
- It scans new JSON files in the `groweasy-webhook-logs` bucket.  
- Cleans and aggregates important information such as:  
  - Inventory levels (stock available per product)  
  - Price fluctuations and history  
  - Sales activity trends  
- Writes the aggregated summaries into the **`groweasy-analytics`** bucket.  
- This creates a continuously updated **clean dataset** that is lightweight and ready for reporting or forecasting.  

---

**AI Forecasting (SageMaker + Lambda)**  
Once aggregated data is available, GrowEasy’s AI pipeline transforms it into **actionable predictions**.  
- A forecasting Lambda (or SageMaker job) reads the summaries from `groweasy-analytics`.  
- It prepares a **time-series dataset** (date, product_id, inventory, price, sales).  
- The dataset is fed into an **LSTM-based forecasting model** in SageMaker.  
- The AI model predicts:  
  - 📦 **Inventory depletion** → when a product is likely to run out of stock  
  - 💰 **Optimal pricing** → recommended price points to maximize revenue without losing sales  
  - 📈 **Future sales** → expected sales for the next 7/30 days  

---

**Predictions → DynamoDB + Dashboard + Alerts**  
- AI results are written into a DynamoDB table (`ProductForecasts`) for **fast, real-time queries**.  
- The **GrowEasy React dashboard** fetches this data via API Gateway + Lambda, showing:  
  - Optimal price recommendations  
  - Restock alerts  
  - Live sales activity with forecast overlay  
  - A **Retail Health Score (0–100)** per product/store  
- At the same time, the pipeline triggers **SNS notifications** (email/Slack) whenever new AI forecasts are generated, e.g.:  
  > *“⚠️ Product XYZ is projected to run out in 5 days. Suggested restock: 50 units.”*

## 🏆 Hackathon Experience: Codex 2.0  

I built **GrowEasy** during the **Codex 2.0 Hackathon** in just **36 hours**, working under extreme pressure with my team.  
- ✅ **Real-life problem solving** → tackled challenges faced by small Shopify merchants like stockouts and wrong pricing.  
- ✅ **Hands-on project building** → designed and implemented the end-to-end AI + cloud pipeline (Shopify → AWS → AI → Dashboard).  
- ✅ **Dynamic price prediction** → added AI-driven **real-time price recommendation engine** to maximize merchant revenue.  
- ✅ **Worked under time constraints** → completed full architecture, backend pipeline, AI forecasting, and dashboard in less than 2 days.  

This project was not just about coding, but about:  
- Thinking like a **cloud/DevOps engineer** under real-world conditions.  
- Delivering a **production-grade system** in limited time.  
- Learning how to handle **team collaboration, stress, and quick decision making** during a hackathon.
